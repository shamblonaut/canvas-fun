      <p>
        I started out my programming journey with HTML around 2019 and the part
        that captivated me the most around that time was the canvas API. It's
        been 5 years now (2024) and I've come a long way since. I wanted to
        rediscover the fun I had while working with the canvas, and I made some
        stuff by playing around:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="./bouncing-balls/index.html">Bouncing Balls</a></li>
        <li>
          <a href="./bouncing-balls-chaotic/index.html"
            >Bouncing Balls (chaotic)</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
